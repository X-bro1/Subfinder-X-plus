# Subfinder-X-plus
🔍 SubFinder X+ - Advanced Subdomain Discovery Suite  

SubFinder X+ is a powerful tool to discover subdomains, combining 14 sources (VirusTotal, URLScan, GitHub, etc.) with optimized brute-force scanning.  

### ✨ Features
- ✅ Multi-source scanning (CERT, OTX, Anubis, HackerTarget, SecurityTrails, Censys, Shodan, VirusTotal, URLScan, GitHub, Google, Bing, ThreatCrowd, BufferOver)
- 🚀 Customizable brute-force with wordlist support and adjustable threads
- 📊 Comprehensive reports in HTML, JSON, and TXT formats
- ⚡ Multithreading (up to 200 threads) for maximum speed
- 🌐 DNS resolution and port scanning (80, 443, 21, 22, 25, 8080, 8443)
- 💾 Auto-save functionality with dedicated results folder
- 🎨 Rich console interface with progress bars and colored output
- 🔄 Graceful CTRL+C handling with automatic backup
- 🔍 Reverse DNS lookup for additional subdomain discovery
- 🤝 Support integration with multiple APIs (SecurityTrails, Censys, Shodan, VirusTotal)
- 🌐 Massive subdomain resolution with bulk DNS lookup
- 📡 Unique IP detection and deduplication
- 🔌 IPv4 support for all network operations

> ### ⚠️ Note: 
> DNS resolution and port scanning may take significant time depending on the quality of the discovered subdomains.  
> The same principle applies to brute-forcing and resolving DNS for identified subdomains.
> > If you stop the scan, all results discovered up to that point will be saved.
